<h1>App Report</h1>

The moviebooking24787CA app is designed to showcase a curated list of movies and facilitate seat selection for each movie. It comprises two primary features: the movie display and seat selection functions.

In the movie display section, users can view essential details such as title, rating, duration, and a brief description for each movie. The app leverages Glide Image loader to fetch and present movie posters sourced from myvue.com, contributing to an enhanced visual experience.

When users interact with a movie, they are directed to the MovieActivity screen, where they can adjust seat selections using intuitive plus and minus icons. The app dynamically updates seat availability and displays a "filling fast" badge when seats are limited, providing users with real-time information.

During development, challenges were encountered, particularly in managing image loading and data transfer between screens. These challenges were addressed by referring to online resources and implementing Glide Image loader for efficient image loading tasks, ensuring smooth functionality across the app.

The project has been a valuable learning experience, deepening my skills in Android app development, UI design, and problem-solving. By overcoming challenges and adopting effective strategies, I've gained practical insights that will inform future app development endeavors. Key learnings include improved data management between app components, troubleshooting skills development, enhanced user engagement through visual elements, and efficient utilization of online resources for continuous learning and skill enhancement.
